In this module, our goal is to provide you with a foundational understanding of information security: how it is structured, which roles are assumed by whom, the various domains/areas of expertise within cybersecurity, and what career opportunities are currently available. This module is fundamentally designed for complete newcomers, those who have found the motivation and made the decision to take the plunge into the vast ocean of cybersecurity.

To make the dive less daunting, we'll give you the necessary overview of how Information Security is broadly structured and organized. The goal here is to equip you with enough knowledge to help you decide where you want to swim, and to develop a sense of the direction you need to take.

**Author's side note:**  
Since we assume you are "new" to this field, unfortunately, we won't be able to hand you practical exercises right away. Imagine you're sitting in a fighter jet, eager to take off. Without knowing what anything in the cockpit is or what it's for, you'll find it extremely challenging (and time consuming) to simply start the aircraft, let alone get the fighter jet airborne. Therefore, this module is purely "theoretical", while at the same time concise and packed with all the essential details. You will encounter and discover all further aspects along your journey in the future modules. Our goal is to help you to become a great and professional specialist in the field you desire. Therefore, we have to give you the necessary picture of the Information Security world first.

Nowadays, we heavily rely on digital platforms for almost everything; communicating with friends, banking, shopping, and running businesses. This means keeping our data safe from unauthorized access or damage is crucial. Information Security, often called `InfoSec`, is all about safeguarding information and systems from people who must not have access to them. This includes preventing unauthorized viewing, changing, or destroying of data.

Look closely at the following graphic and try to memorize it. It illustrates, in a very simplified manner, the approximate structure/landscape of the digital world. We will go through this piece by piece in the upcoming sections, and you will understand how all these elements are interconnected.

- `Client`: This is a PC/Laptop through which you access resources and services "on the Internet".
    
- `Internet`: This is a vast, interconnected network of servers that offer different services and applications, such as Hack The Box.
    
- `Servers`: Servers provide various services and applications designed to perform specific tasks. For example, one type of server might be a "web server", allowing you and others to view the content of a website (such as this section you're reading currently) on your computer or smartphone.
    
- `Network`: When multiple servers or computers are connected and can communicate with each other, it's called a network.
    
- `Cloud`: Cloud refers to data centers that offer interconnected servers for companies and individuals to use.
    
- `Blue Team`: This team is responsible for the internal security of the company and defends against cyber attacks.
    
- `Red Team`: This team simulates an actual adversary/attack on the company.
    
- `Purple Team`: This team consists of both Blue Team and Red Team members working together to enhance the company's security.
    

We'll delve more into these teams and other aspects in individual sections.

If you're looking to become a penetration tester - a professional who finds and fixes security weaknesses in systems - understanding InfoSec is essential. Your job is to identify potential vulnerabilities before malicious hackers can exploit them. By learning about strong security measures, you can help organizations protect their valuable information and prevent unauthorized access.

More services and systems are moving online in a trend known as digital transformation. While this shift offers many benefits like convenience and efficiency, it also creates more opportunities for cyber attacks. Hackers are getting smarter and more aggressive, aiming to steal sensitive data or disrupt services. These cyber attacks can lead to significant financial losses and damage a company's reputation and customer trust.

Imagine your information is like treasure stored in a castle. The castle's walls, drawbridges, and guards are the security measures protecting your treasure from thieves.

- `The Treasure`: Your valuable data and information.
- `The Castle Walls`: Firewalls, defensive mechanisms, and encryption that keep outsiders from getting in.
- `The Guards`: Security protocols and access controls that monitor who enters and leaves.
- `Penetration Testers`: Knights who test the castle's defenses by simulating attacks to find weak spots.
- `Digital Transformation`: Expanding the castle to store more treasure, which attracts more thieves.
- `Cyber Threats`: Thieves who are constantly looking for ways to breach the castle's defenses.

Just as a castle must strengthen its defenses as it grows and becomes a more valuable target, businesses must enhance their InfoSec measures as they move more services online. By thinking of InfoSec as a building or fortress to protect, it becomes easier to understand the importance of strong security in the digital age.

The necessity of InfoSec stems from the value of information in the digital age. Personal data, intellectual property, financial information, and government secrets are just a few examples of the critical data that needs protection. A breach can lead to severe consequences, including financial loss, reputational damage, legal ramifications, and national security threats.

## Areas of Information Security

InfoSec plays an integral role in safeguarding an organization's data from various threats, ensuring the `confidentiality`, `integrity`, and `availability` of data. This wide-ranging field incorporates a variety of domains, and the list provided here captures some of the most general assets. However, it is essential to note that these examples merely scratch the surface of the broad spectrum that InfoSec covers.

The actual range of assets that fall under the umbrella of InfoSec is far more extensive and continues to evolve in tandem with advancements in technology and the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats, consisting of but not limited to:

1. Network Security
2. Application Security
3. Operational Security
4. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity
5. Cloud Security
6. Physical Security
7. Mobile Security
8. Internet of Things (IoT) Security

Later on, we will also explore some of the most prevalent `cyber threats`, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, ransomware, advanced persistent threats (APTs), and insider threats. Additionally, we will examine the structure and function of `cybersecurity teams`, gaining an understanding of their areas of specialization and the key roles within these teams. This comprehensive overview will provide valuable insights into how cybersecurity professionals collaborate to mitigate and respond to these evolving threats.

#### Security Concepts

A risk in the context of information security refers to the potential for a malicious event to occur, which could cause damage to an organization's assets, such as its data or infrastructure. This potential for damage is typically quantified in terms of its likelihood and the severity of its impact. Risk is a broader concept that encapsulates both threats and vulnerabilities, and managing risk involves identifying and applying appropriate measures to mitigate threats and minimize vulnerabilities.

A threat, on the other hand, is a potential cause of an incident that could result in harm to a system or organization. It could be a person, like a cybercriminal or hacker, or it could be a natural event, like a fire or flood. Threats exploit vulnerabilities to compromise the security of a system.

A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that could be exploited by a threat. Vulnerabilities can exist in various forms, such as software bugs, misconfigurations, or weak passwords. The presence of a vulnerability doesn't necessarily mean a system will be compromised; there must also be a threat capable of exploiting that vulnerability, and the potential damage that could result constitutes the risk.

In essence, a risk represents the potential for damage, a threat is what can cause that damage, and a vulnerability is the weakness that allows the threat to cause damage. All three concepts are interconnected, and understanding the difference between them is essential for effective information security management.

#### Roles in Information Security

In the expansive world of Information Security (InfoSec), there are a plethora of different roles each carrying their unique set of responsibilities. These roles are integral parts of a robust InfoSec infrastructure, contributing to the secure operations of an organization:

|**Role**|**Description**|**Relevance to Penetration Testing**|
