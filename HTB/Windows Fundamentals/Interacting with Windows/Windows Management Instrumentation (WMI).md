WMI is a subsystem of PowerShell that provides system administrators with powerful tools for system monitoring. The goal of WMI is to consolidate device and application management across corporate networks. WMI is a core part of the Windows operating system and has come pre-installed since Windows 2000. It is made up of the following components:

| **Component Name** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| WMI service        | The Windows Management Instrumentation process, which runs automatically at boot and acts as an intermediary between WMI providers, the WMI repository, and managing applications. |
| Managed objects    | Any logical or physical components that can be managed by WMI.                                                                                                                     |
| WMI providers      | Objects that monitor events/data related to a specific object.                                                                                                                     |
| Classes            | These are used by the WMI providers to pass data to the WMI service.                                                                                                               |
| Methods            | These are attached to classes and allow actions to be performed. For example, methods can be used to start/stop processes on remote machines.                                      |
| WMI repository     | A database that stores all static data related to WMI.                                                                                                                             |
| CMI Object Manager | The system that requests data from WMI providers and returns it to the application requesting it.                                                                                  |
| WMI API            | Enables applications to access the WMI infrastructure.                                                                                                                             |
| WMI Consumer       | Sends queries to objects via the CMI Object Manager.                                                                                                                               |

Some of the uses for WMI are:

-   Status information for local/remote systems
-   Configuring security settings on remote machines/applications
-   Setting and changing user and group permissions
-   Setting/modifying system properties
-   Code execution
-   Scheduling processes
-   Setting up logging

These tasks can all be performed using a combination of PowerShell and the WMI Command-Line Interface (WMIC). WMI can be run via the Windows command prompt by typing `WMIC` to open an interactive shell or by running a command directly such as `wmic computersystem get name` to get the hostname. We can view a listing of WMIC commands and aliases by typing `WMIC /?`.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic /?

WMIC is deprecated.

[global switches] <command>

The following global switches are available:
/NAMESPACE           Path for the namespace the alias operate against.
/ROLE                Path for the role containing the alias definitions.
/NODE                Servers the alias will operate against.
/IMPLEVEL            Client impersonation level.
/AUTHLEVEL           Client authentication level.
/LOCALE              Language id the client should use.
/PRIVILEGES          Enable or disable all privileges.
/TRACE               Outputs debugging information to stderr.
/RECORD              Logs all input commands and output.
/INTERACTIVE         Sets or resets the interactive mode.
/FAILFAST            Sets or resets the FailFast mode.
/USER                User to be used during the session.
/PASSWORD            Password to be used for session login.
/OUTPUT              Specifies the mode for output redirection.
/APPEND              Specifies the mode for output redirection.
/AGGREGATE           Sets or resets aggregate mode.
/AUTHORITY           Specifies the <authority type> for the connection.
/?[:<BRIEF|FULL>]    Usage information.

For more information on a specific global switch, type: switch-name /?

Press any key to continue, or press the ESCAPE key to stop

The following command example lists information about the operating system.

```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic os list brief

BuildNumber  Organization  RegisteredUser  SerialNumber             SystemDirectory      Version
19041                      Owner           00123-00123-00123-AAOEM  C:\Windows\system32  10.0.19041
```

WMIC uses aliases and associated verbs, adverbs, and switches. The above command example uses `LIST` to show data and the adverb `BRIEF` to provide just the core set of properties. An in-depth listing of verbs, switches, and adverbs is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/wmic). WMI can be used with PowerShell by using the `Get-WmiObject` [module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-wmiobject?view=powershell-5.1). This module is used to get instances of WMI classes or information about available classes. This module can be used against local or remote machines.

Here we can get information about the operating system.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_OperatingSystem | select SystemDirectory,BuildNumber,SerialNumber,Version | ft

SystemDirectory     BuildNumber SerialNumber            Version
---------------     ----------- ------------            -------
C:\Windows\system32 19041       00123-00123-00123-AAOEM 10.0.19041
```

We can also use the `Invoke-WmiMethod` [module](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/invoke-wmimethod?view=powershell-5.1), which is used to call the methods of WMI objects. A simple example is renaming a file. We can see that the command completed properly because the `ReturnValue` is set to 0.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Invoke-WmiMethod -Path "CIM_DataFile.Name='C:\users\public\spns.csv'" -Name Rename -ArgumentList "C:\Users\Public\kerberoasted_users.csv"


__GENUS          : 2
__CLASS          : __PARAMETERS
__SUPERCLASS     :
__DYNASTY        : __PARAMETERS
__RELPATH        :
__PROPERTY_COUNT : 1
__DERIVATION     : {}
__SERVER         :
__NAMESPACE      :
__PATH           :
ReturnValue      : 0
PSComputerName   :
```

This section provides a brief overview of `WMI`, `WMIC`, and combining `WMIC` and `PowerShell`. `WMI` has a wide variety of uses for both blue team and red team operators. Later sections of this course will show some ways that `WMI` can be leveraged offensively for both enumeration and lateral movement.

Use WMI to find the serial number of the system.
