What limitations were you given for this exercise? - None.

So, why didn't you think to add more digits or to replace the given arithmetic operations?

Welcome to the hacker's way of thinking called:

"**`Outside the box`**."

So, why didn't we think like that? During this learning path, we will acquire more information that will help us find an answer. However, first, we have to understand the way of thinking we currently use. Make it clearer. Try to understand what we have to work on.

##### Optional Exercise:

Why didn't you consider changing the arithmetic operations? Why didn't you think to add more digits? Try to answer as detailed as possible on your own. Try to write about it in at least 200 words.

ANSWER:

- at first my mind was set to only use integral numbers, once i found an specific way to solve the problem easily my brain was locked on fixing it that specific way, finding several different possibilities. That being said, the more i focused on that answer, the more my mind strayed away from just trying to find different arithmetic ways of solving it, completely forgetting all kind of learnings i had when i studied math at a young age, probably adding some floating numbers to the possible inputs, or negative numbers, making the range of answers increase exponentialy
