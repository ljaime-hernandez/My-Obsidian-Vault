When enumerating a system, it is important to note down any credentials. These may be found in configuration files (`.conf`, `.config`, `.xml`, etc.), shell scripts, a user's bash history file, backup (`.bak`) files, within database files or even in text files. Credentials may be useful for escalating to other users or even root, accessing databases and other systems within the environment.

The /var directory typically contains the web root for whatever web server is running on the host. The web root may contain database credentials or other types of credentials that can be leveraged to further access. A common example is MySQL database credentials within WordPress configuration files:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cat wp-config.php | grep 'DB_USER\|DB_PASSWORD'

define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'WPadmin123!' );
```

The spool or mail directories, if accessible, may also contain valuable information or even credentials. It is common to find credentials stored in files in the web root (i.e. MySQL connection strings, WordPress configuration files).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$  find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -iname "*config*" -type f 2>/dev/null

/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/etc/python3/debian_config
/etc/kbd/config
/etc/manpath.config
/boot/config-4.4.0-116-generic
/boot/grub/i386-pc/configfile.mod
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0/config
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/config
<SNIP>
```

## SSH Keys

It is also useful to search around the system for accessible SSH private keys. We may locate a private key for another, more privileged, user that we can use to connect back to the box with additional privileges. We may also sometimes find SSH keys that can be used to access other hosts in the environment. Whenever finding SSH keys check the `known_hosts` file to find targets. This file contains a list of public keys for all the hosts which the user has connected to in the past and may be useful for lateral movement or to find data on a remote host that can be used to perform privilege escalation on our target.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$  ls ~/.ssh

id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```

* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* go to the "var" folder, then go to the "www" folder, then the "html" folder
* open the "index.php" file, you can help yourself for it to be readable by using a webpage like https://html.onlineviewer.net
* on the installation part, they mention a "wp-config.php" file, open the file with the same name in the html folder
