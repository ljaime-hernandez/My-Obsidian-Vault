`Netfilter` is a Linux kernel module that provides, among other things, packet filtering, network address translation, and other tools relevant to firewalls. It controls and regulates network traffic by manipulating individual packets based on their characteristics and rules. `Netfilter` is also called the software layer in the Linux kernel. When network packets are received and sent, it initiates the execution of other modules such as packet filters. These modules can then intercept and manipulate packets. This includes the programs like `iptables` and `arptables`, which serve as action mechanisms of the `Netfilter` hook system of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stack.

This kernel module has three main functions:

1. Packet defragmentation
2. Connection tracking
3. Network address translation (NAT)

When the module is activated, all IP packets are checked by the `Netfilter` before they are forwarded to the target application of the own or remote system. In 2021 ([CVE-2021-22555](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/linux/cve-2021-22555)), 2022 ([CVE-2022-1015](https://github.com/pqlx/CVE-2022-1015)), and also in 2023 ([CVE-2023-32233](https://github.com/Liuk3r/CVE-2023-32233)), several vulnerabilities were found that could lead to privilege escalation.

Many companies have preconfigured Linux distributions adapted to their software applications or vice versa. This gives the developers and administrators, metaphorically speaking, a "dynamic basis" that is difficult to replace. This would require either adapting the system to the software application or adapting the application to the newer system. Depending on the size and complexity of the application, this can take a great deal of time and effort. This is often why so many companies run older and not updated Linux distributions in production.

Even if the company uses virtual machines or containers like Docker, these are built on a specific kernel. The idea of isolating the software application from the existing host system is a good step, but there are many ways to break out of such a container.

#### CVE-2022-25636

A recent vulnerability is [CVE-2022-25636](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-25636/) and affects Linux kernel 5.4 through 5.6.10. This is `net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c`, which can grant root privileges to local users due to heap out-of-bounds write. `Nick Gregory` wrote a very detailed [article](https://nickgregory.me/post/2022/03/12/cve-2022-25636/) about how he discovered this vulnerability.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@ubuntu:~$ uname -r

5.13.0-051300-generic
```

However, we need to be careful with this exploit as it can corrupt the kernel, and a reboot will be required to reaccess the server.

#### CVE-2023-32233

This vulnerability exploits the so called `anonymous sets` in `nf_tables` by using the `Use-After-Free` vulnerability in the Linux Kernel up to version `6.3.1`. These `nf_tables` are temporary workspaces for processing batch requests and once the processing is done, these anonymous sets are supposed to be cleared out (`Use-After-Free`) so they cannot be used anymore. Due to a mistake in the code, these anonymous sets are not being handled properly and can still be accessed and modified by the program.

The exploitation is done by manipulating the system to use the `cleared out` anonymous sets to interact with the kernel's memory. By doing so, we can potentially gain `root` privileges.

#### Proof-Of-Concept

cry0l1t3@ubuntu:~$ cd CVE-2023-32233
