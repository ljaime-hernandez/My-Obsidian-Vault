[PATH](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html) is an environment variable that specifies the set of directories where an executable can be located. An account's PATH variable is a set of absolute paths, allowing a user to type a command without specifying the absolute path to the binary. For example, a user can type `cat /tmp/test.txt` instead of specifying the absolute path `/bin/cat /tmp/test.txt`. We can check the contents of the PATH variable by typing `env | grep PATH` or `echo $PATH`.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

Creating a script or program in a directory specified in the PATH will make it executable from any directory on the system.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ pwd && conncheck 

/usr/local/sbin
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:22              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp        0     88 10.129.2.12:22          10.10.14.3:43218        ESTABLISHED 1614/sshd: mrb3n [p
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1304/apache2    
```

As shown below, the `conncheck` script created in `/usr/local/sbin` will still run when in the `/tmp` directory because it was created in a directory specified in the PATH.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ pwd && conncheck 

/tmp
Active Internet connections (servers and established)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address           Foreign Address         State       PID/Program name

tcp        0    268 10.129.2.12:22          10.10.14.3:43218        ESTABLISHED 1614/sshd: mrb3n [p
tcp6       0      0 :::22                   :::*                    LISTEN      1189/sshd       
tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      1304/apache2     
```

Adding `.` to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as `ls` with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add `.` to the path by issuing the command `PATH=.:$PATH` and then `export PATH`, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing `ls` will call the malicious script named `ls` in the current working directory instead of the binary located at `/bin/ls`).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

  Path Abuse

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ PATH=.:${PATH}
htb_student@NIX02:~$ export PATH
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

.:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

In this example, we modify the path to run a simple `echo` command when the command `ls` is typed.

  Path Abuse

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ touch ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ chmod +x ls
```

  Path Abuse

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ls

PATH ABUSE!!
```





#### Questions

Review the PATH of the htb-student user. What non-default directory is part of the user's PATH?

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* Run command " echo $PATH"
* check on the /tmp directory, which is the answer
