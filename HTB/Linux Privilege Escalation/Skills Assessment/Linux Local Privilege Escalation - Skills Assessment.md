We have been contracted to perform a security hardening assessment against one of the `INLANEFREIGHT` organizations' public-facing web servers.

The client has provided us with a low privileged user to assess the security of the server. Connect via SSH and begin looking for misconfigurations and other flaws that may escalate privileges using the skills learned throughout this module.

Once on the host, we must find `five` flags on the host, accessible at various privilege levels. Escalate privileges all the way from the `htb-student` user to the `root` user and submit all five flags to finish this module.  

Note: There is a way to obtain a shell on the box instead of using the SSH credentials if you would like to make the scenario more challenging. This is optional and does not award more points or count towards completion.
