A `Virtual Private Server` (`VPS`) is an isolated environment created on a physical server using virtualization technology. A VPS is fundamentally part of `Infrastructure-as-a-Service` (`IaaS`) solutions. This solution offers all the advantages of an ordinary server, with specially allocated resources and complete management freedom. We can freely choose the operating system and applications we want to use, with no configuration restrictions. This VM uses the resources of a physical server and provides users with various server functionalities comparable to those of a dedicated server. It is therefore also referred to as a `Virtual Dedicated Server` (`VDS`).

A VPS positions itself as a compromise between inexpensive shared hosting and the usually costly rental of dedicated server technology. This hosting model's idea is to offer users the most comprehensive possible range of functions at manageable prices. The virtual replication of individual computer systems on a standard host system involves significantly less effort for a web hoster than the provision of separate hardware components for each customer. Extensive independence of the individual guest systems is achieved through encapsulation. Each VPS on the shared hardware base acts isolated from other, parallel operating systems. In most cases, VPS is used for the following purposes, but not limited to:

| Webserver | LAMP/XAMPP stack | Mail server | DNS servermarkdown |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development server | Proxy server | Test server | Code repository
| Pentesting | VPN | Gaming server | C2 server |

We can choose from a range of Windows and Linux operating systems to provide the required operating environment for our desired application or software during installation.
