Whether we are on an internal or external penetration test, a VPS that we can use is of great importance to us in many different cases. We can store all our resources on it and access them from almost any point with internet access. Apart from the fact that we first have to set up the VPS, we also have to prepare the corresponding folder structure and its services. In this example, we will deal with the provider called [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/) and set up our VPS there. For the other providers, the configuration options look almost identical.

We should still read the individual information about their components carefully and understand what kind of VPS we will be working with in the future. In Vultr, we can choose one of the four different servers. For our purposes, the `Cloud Computer` server is sufficient for now.
