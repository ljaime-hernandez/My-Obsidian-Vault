File system management on Linux is a complex process that involves organizing and maintaining the data stored on a disk or other storage device. Linux is a powerful operating system that supports a wide range of file systems, including ext2, ext3, ext4, XFS, Btrfs, NTFS, and more. Each of these file systems offers unique features and benefits, and the best choice for any given situation will depend upon the specific requirements of the application or user. For example, ext2 is suitable for basic file system management tasks, while Btrfs offers robust data integrity and snapshot capabilities. Additionally, NTFS is useful when compatibility with Windows is required. No matter the situation, it is important to properly analyze the needs of the application or user before selecting a file system.

The Linux file system is based on the Unix file system, which is a hierarchical structure that is composed of various components. At the top of this structure is the inode table, the basis for the entire file system. The inode table is a table of information associated with each file and directory on a Linux system. Inodes contain metadata about the file or directory, such as its permissions, size, type, owner, and so on. The inode table is like a database of information about every file and directory on a Linux system, allowing the operating system to quickly access and manage files. Files can be stored in the Linux file system in one of two ways:

-   Regular files
-   Directories

Regular files are the most common type of file, and they are stored in the root directory of the file system. Directories are used to store collections of files. When a file is stored in a directory, the directory is known as the parent directory for the files. In addition to regular files and directories, Linux also supports symbolic links, which are references to other files or directories. Symbolic links can be used to quickly access files that are located in different parts of the file system. Each file and directory needs to be managed in terms of permissions. Permissions control who has access to files and directories. Each file and directory has an associated set of permissions that determines who can read, write, and execute the file. The same permissions apply to all users, so if the permissions of one user are changed, all other users will also be affected.

## Disks & Drives

Disk management on Linux involves managing physical storage devices, including hard drives, solid-state drives, and removable storage devices. The main tool for disk management on Linux is the `fdisk`, which allows us to create, delete, and manage partitions on a drive. It can also display information about the partition table, including the size and type of each partition. Partitioning a drive on Linux involves dividing the physical storage space into separate, logical sections. Each partition can then be formatted with a specific file system, such as ext4, NTFS, or FAT32, and can be mounted as a separate file system. The most common partitioning tool on Linux is also `fdisk`, `gpart`, and `GParted`.

#### Fdisk

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ sudo fdisk -l

Disk /dev/vda: 160 GiB, 171798691840 bytes, 335544320 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes

I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
```

## Mounting

Each logical partition or drive needs to be assigned to a specific directory on Linux. This process is called mounting. Mounting involves attaching a drive to a specific directory, making it accessible to the file system hierarchy. Once a drive is mounted, it can be accessed and manipulated just like any other directory on the system. The `mount` tool is used to mount file systems on Linux, and the `/etc/fstab` file is used to define the default file systems that are mounted at boot time.

#### Mounted File systems at Boot

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/fstab

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system>                      <mount point>  <type>  <options>  <dump>  <pass>
UUID=3d6a020d-...SNIP...-9e085e9c927a /              btrfs   subvol=@,defaults,noatime,nodiratime,nodatacow,space_cache,autodefrag 0 1
UUID=3d6a020d-...SNIP...-9e085e9c927a /home          btrfs   subvol=@home,defaults,noatime,nodiratime,nodatacow,space_cache,autodefrag 0 2
UUID=21f7eb94-...SNIP...-d4f58f94e141 swap           swap    defaults,noatime 0 0

```

To view the currently mounted file systems, we can use the "mount" command without any arguments. The output will show a list of all the currently mounted file systems, including the device name, file system type, mount point, and options.

#### List Mounted Drives

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ mount

sysfs on /sys type sysfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
proc on /proc type proc (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime)
udev on /dev type devtmpfs (rw,nosuid,relatime,size=4035812k,nr_inodes=1008953,mode=755,inode64)
devpts on /dev/pts type devpts (rw,nosuid,noexec,relatime,gid=5,mode=620,ptmxmode=000)
tmpfs on /run type tmpfs (rw,nosuid,nodev,noexec,relatime,size=814580k,mode=755,inode64)
/dev/vda1 on / type btrfs (rw,noatime,nodiratime,nodatasum,nodatacow,space_cache,autodefrag,subvolid=257,subvol=/@)
```

To mount a file system, we can use the `mount` command followed by the device name and the mount point. For example, to mount a USB drive with the device name `/dev/sdb1` to the directory `/mnt/usb`, we would use the following command:

#### Mount a USB drive

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ cd /mnt/usb && ls -l

```

To unmount a file system in Linux, we can use the `umount` command followed by the mount point of the file system we want to unmount. The mount point is the location in the file system where the file system is mounted and is accessible to us. For example, to unmount the USB drive that was previously mounted to the directory `/mnt/usb`, we would use the following command:

#### Unmount

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ sudo umount /mnt/usb
```

It is important to note that we must have sufficient permissions to unmount a file system. We also cannot unmount a file system that is in use by a running process. To ensure that there are no running processes that are using the file system, we can use the `lsof` command to list the open files on the file system.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@htb:~$ lsof | grep cry0l1t3

vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402274 /usr/bin/perl (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24      1554101 /usr/lib/locale/aa_DJ.utf8/LC_COLLATE (path dev=0,26)

vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402327 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/auto/Socket/Socket.so (path dev=0,26)
vncserver 6006        cry0l1t3  mem       REG      0,24       402324 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/perl-base/auto/IO/IO.so (path dev=0,26)
...SNIP...
```

If we find any processes that are using the file system, we need to stop them before we can unmount the file system. Additionally, we can also unmount a file system automatically when the system is shut down by adding an entry to the `/etc/fstab` file. The `/etc/fstab` file contains information about all the file systems that are mounted on the system, including the options for automatic mounting at boot time and other mount options. To unmount a file system automatically at shutdown, we need to add the `noauto` option to the entry in the `/etc/fstab` file for that file system. This would like, for example, like following:

#### Fstab File

```txt
/dev/sda1 / ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sda2 /home ext4 defaults 0 0
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb ext4 rw,auto,user 0 0
192.168.1.100:/nfs /mnt/nfs nfs defaults 0 0
```

## SWAP

Swap space is a crucial aspect of memory management in Linux, and it plays an important role in ensuring that the system runs smoothly, even when the available physical memory is depleted. When the system runs out of physical memory, the kernel transfers inactive pages of memory to the swap space, freeing up physical memory for use by active processes. This process is known as swapping.

Swap space can be created either during the installation of the operating system or at any time afterward using the `mkswap` and `swapon` commands. The `mkswap` command is used to set up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file, while the `swapon` command is used to activate a swap area. The size of the swap space is a matter of personal preference and depends on the amount of physical memory installed in the system and the type of usage the system will be subjected to. When creating a swap space, it is important to ensure that it is placed on a dedicated partition or file, separate from the rest of the file system. This helps to prevent fragmentation of the swap space and ensures that the system has adequate swap space available when it is needed. It is also important to ensure that the swap space is encrypted, as sensitive data may be stored in the swap space temporarily.

In addition to being used as an extension of physical memory, swap space can also be used for hibernation, which is a power management feature that allows the system to save its state to disk and then power off instead of shutting down completely. When the system is later powered on, it can restore its state from the swap space, returning to the state it was in before it was powered off.
