You have been contracted by the company `Inlanefreight` to perform an internal vulnerability assessment against one of their servers. They have asked for a cursory assessment to be performed to identify any significant vulnerabilities as they do not have the budget for a full-scale penetration test this year. The results of this vulnerability assessment may enable the CISO to push for additional funding from the Board of Directors to perform more in-depth security testing.

The target server is a Windows Server host used as a development server.

## Requirements

Navigate to the web interface at the end of this section and log in with the provided credentials.

Once logged in, perform a `BASIC NETWORK SCAN` (modify the scan template to scan `ALL` ports, leave all other options the same) against the target: `172.16.16.100`. Additionally, set up the scan to be authenticated using `administrator:Academy_VA_adm1!` as the credentials.

The scan will take up to 60 minutes to finish.

_Note: It may take 1-2 minutes for your target instance to spawn. Additionally, it may take up to an hour for the scan to run_

Alternatively, use the pre-populated scan data to answer the questions below without having to wait for the scan to finish but feel free to practice configuring and running it.


What is the name of one of the accessible SMB shares from the authenticated Windows scan? (One word)

`wsus`
* run command `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8834`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on the vulnerabilities tab
* type `SMB share` in the search bar
* click on `Microsoft Windows SMB Shares Enumeration`
* type one of the SMB shares

What were the targets for the authenticated scan?

`172.16.16.100`
* run command `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`

* click on the vulnerabilities tab
* type `target` in the search bar
* click on `Target Credential Status by Authentication Protocol - Valid Credentials Provided`
* on the output portion, check on the host (ip)


What is the plugin ID of the highest criticality vulnerability for the Windows authenticated scan?

`156032`
* run command `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8834`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on the vulnerabilities tab
* check the first critical vulnerability called `Apache Log4j Unsupported Version Detection` and its plugin ID

What is the name of the vulnerability with plugin ID 26925 from the Windows authenticated scan? (Case sensitive)

`VNC Server Unauthenticated Access`
* run command `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8834`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* download the HTML version of the report
* run command `open <filename>.hmtl` on your download folder
* press CTRL + F and type plugin ID

What port is the VNC server running on in the authenticated Windows scan?

`5900`
* run command `sudo systemctl start nessusd.service`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8834`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on the vulnerabilities tab
* type VNC in the search bar and click on the vulnerability with high severity
* check the output portion for the port used
