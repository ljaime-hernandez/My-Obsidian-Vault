You have been contracted by the company `Inlanefreight` to perform an internal vulnerability assessment against one of their servers. They have asked for a cursory assessment to be performed to identify any significant vulnerabilities as they do not have the budget for a full-scale penetration test this year. The results of this vulnerability assessment may enable the CISO to push for additional funding from the Board of Directors to perform more in-depth security testing.

The target server is a Linux Server host.

## Requirements

Navigate to the OpenVAS web interface at the server below and log in with the provided credentials.

Once logged in, create a new task with the `OpenVAS Default` Scanner and use the `Full and Fast` config against the target: `172.16.16.160`. Additionally, ensure you have the scan set up to run as an authenticated user using the credentials: `root:HTB_@cademy_admin!`.

The scan will take up to 60 minutes to finish.

_Note: It may take 1-2 minutes for your target instance to spawn._

Alternatively, use the pre-populated scan data to answer the questions below without having to wait for the scan to finish but feel free to practice configuring and running it.


What type of operating system is the Linux host running? (one word)

`ubuntu`
* run command `sudo gvm-start`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8080`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on Assets tab - Operating Systems
* look for linux OS

What type of FTP vulnerability is on the Linux host? (Case Sensitive, four words)

`Anonymous FTP Login Reporting`
* run command `sudo gvm-start`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8080`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on Scans tab - Results
* on search bar, type `FTP`

What is the IP of the Linux host targeted for the scan?

`172.16.16.160`
* run command `sudo gvm-start`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8080`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on Scans tab - Results
* check the Host - IP portion of the results

What vulnerability is associated with the HTTP server? (Case-sensitive)

`Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information via HTTP`
* run command `sudo gvm-start`
* use firefox and access to `https://<ip provided>:8080`
* use HTB credentials `admin:htb-student` and `password:HTB_@cademy_student!`
* click on Scans tab - Results
* on search bar, type `HTTP`
* arrange results by severity, copy the first vulnerability which has the string `HTTP`
