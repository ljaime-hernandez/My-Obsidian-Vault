## Exporting Formats

There are various export formats for reporting purposes, including XML, CSV, PDF, ITG, and TXT. If you choose to export your report out as an XML, you can leverage various XML parsers to view the data in an easier to read format.

We will export our results in XML and use the [openvasreporting](https://github.com/TheGroundZero/openvasreporting) tool by the TheGroundZero. The `openvasreporting` tool offers various options when generating output. We are using the standard option for an Excel file for this report.

```shell-session
Luis Miguel Jaime Hernandez@htb[/htb]$ python3 -m openvasreporting -i report-2bf466b5-627d-4659-bea6-1758b43235b1.xml -f xlsx
```
